              Dark matter: I have a deep interest in the study of dark matter,
              which makes up the majority of the matter in the universe but
              remains largely mysterious.

              Gravitational waves: I have contributed to the study of
              gravitational waves, which provide a new way of exploring the
              universe and have opened up new avenues for research in
              astrophysics.

            <li className="mt-6">
              Observational tools: I have expertise in the use of cutting-edge
              observational tools, such as telescopes and other instruments, to
              collect data on the universe.

              Computational tools: I am also skilled in the use of computational
              tools and mathematical models to analyze data and develop theories
              that help to deepen our understanding of the cosmos.

              Supermassive black holes: I am currently conducting research on
              the behavior of supermassive black holes, particularly their role
              in shaping the galaxies they reside in.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-6">
              Gravitational waves: I am continuing my work on the study of
              gravitational waves, particularly in the context of the detection
              and interpretation of these waves from sources across the
              universe.

              Dark matter: I am also currently focused on understanding the
              nature of dark matter and its impact on the formation and
              evolution of galaxies.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-6">
              Cosmology: My research also involves the study of the large-scale
              structure of the universe, including the distribution of matter
              and the evolution of cosmic structures.

              Interdisciplinary approaches: Finally, I am interested in
              exploring interdisciplinary approaches to astrophysics, including
              the intersection of astrophysics with fields such as computer
              science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
